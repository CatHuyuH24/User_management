# System Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the user management web application.

## 1. Architectural Approach

We will adopt a **Microservices Architecture**. This approach offers several advantages for this project:

- **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its load. For instance, if the authentication service experiences high traffic, we can scale it without affecting the user profile service.
- **Flexibility in Technology:** While we are starting with FastAPI, a microservices approach allows us to use different technologies for different services in the future if needed.
- **Resilience:** If one service fails, it doesn't necessarily bring down the entire application.
- **Maintainability:** Services are smaller and more focused, making them easier to understand, develop, and maintain.

## 2. High-Level Architecture Diagram

```
+-----------------+      +--------------------+      +---------------------+
|   Web Browser   |----->|    API Gateway     |----->|  Auth Service       |
+-----------------+      +--------------------+      +---------------------+
        |                      |
        |                      |
        +--------------------->|  User Profile Service |
                               +---------------------+
```

- **Web Browser:** The client-side application that the user interacts with.
- **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservice, handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.
- **Auth Service:** Responsible for user sign-up, login, and token management (e.g., JWT).
- **User Profile Service:** Manages user data such as name, year of birth, description, and avatar.

## 3. Service Breakdown

### 3.1. User Service (user-service)

- **Technology:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - **User Authentication:**
    - Handle user registration (sign-up).
    - Handle user login and issue JWT tokens.
    - Handle user logout (token invalidation).
  - **User Profile Management:**
    - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user profiles.
    - Handle avatar uploads, potentially storing them in a cloud storage solution like AWS S3 or a local file store.
- **Database:** A relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB could be used. For this project, we'll start with PostgreSQL for its robustness and data integrity features.

## 4. Data Management

- Each microservice will have its own dedicated database to ensure loose coupling.
- Data consistency between services can be managed through asynchronous events or API calls. For this project, since we are starting with a single `user-service`, this is not an immediate concern.

## 5. Deployment

- Each microservice will be containerized using **Docker**.
- **Docker Compose** will be used to orchestrate the services for local development and testing.
- For production, a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes would be the recommended choice for managing and scaling the services.
